## Description
This week we had to build an application that would prompt a user for inputs in order to build a read me file. This is incredibly useful for generating readme files for projects you may be workng on. Features i'd like to complete in the future include adding navigation through clicking the table of content links.

## Usage
This is a simple Readme generator for projects.
